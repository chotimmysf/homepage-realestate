BACKSTORY

This project was inspired by the "Real Estate Website Homepage" project in this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/css-grid-flexbox-the-ultimate-course-build-10-projects/learn/lecture/12970348#content" target="_blank"> Udemy CSS Course. </a> This is a static homepage of FLOW's web app.

PROJECT JOURNEY INSIGHTS

While doing this project, I saw CSS grid elements and how grid elements divide sections of HTML up. I also learned methods of moving around HTML using CSS. Additionally, I saw that CSS itself has capabilities to support variables - it makes CSS seem a bit like SCSS/SASS.

APP OVERVIEW

Property Search: A simple search form for properties, based on city location and number of total rooms.

Properties on Sale: This section is composed of 2 separate CSS grid elements: 1 of 2 fractions for the first 2 properties on sale, and the other element of 4 fractions to advertise the other 4 properties advertised on the site.

Footer: Displays three sections, one about the foundation of FLOW, the "navigation" containing 3 links to other pages of the FLOW website, and urgently selling properites for sale.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

HTML

CSS

CHALLENGES

Git Repository: I had issues updating this repository, as I renamed the repo (and thus interrupted the connection between my local repo and this Git repo)

Image Resizing: I was confused on which CSS element was making
the images on the "Properties on Sale" section smaller than expected. I eventually found the issue - I entered a small value
for the CSS columns of the "properties-container" section.

Inexperience and Time Management: Unsure of what actual technologies, time, and effort behind CSS grid elements. Took an extra week to slowly
watch the Udemy course videos to hear and see grid elements in
action. App development took 3 weeks, rather than the targeted 2
weeks scope.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

Refine Skills: Review HTML/CSS elements/functions

Memory: Have an idea of which part of CSS code is styling the HTML element I am looking at (ex. "properties-container" is sizing and styling the images and their layout)
