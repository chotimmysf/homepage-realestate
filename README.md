BACKSTORY

This project was inspired by the "Real Estate Website Homepage" project in this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/css-grid-flexbox-the-ultimate-course-build-10-projects/learn/lecture/12970348#content" target="_blank"> Udemy CSS Course. </a> This is a static homepage of FLOW's web app.

PROJECT JOURNEY INSIGHTS

While doing this project, I saw CSS grid elements and how grid elements divide sections of HTML up. I also learned methods of moving around HTML using CSS. Additionally, I saw that CSS itself has capabilities to support variables - it makes CSS seem a bit like SCSS/SASS.

APP OVERVIEW

Property Search: A simple search form for properties, based on city location and number of total rooms.

Properties on Sale: This section is composed of 2 separate CSS grid elements: 1 of 2 fractions for the first 2 properties on sale, and the other element of 4 fractions to advertise the other 4 properties advertised on the site.

Footer: Displays three sections, one about the foundation of FLOW, the "navigation" containing 3 links to other pages of the FLOW website, and urgently selling properites for sale.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

HTML

CSS

CHALLENGES

Git Repository: I had issues updating this repository, as I renamed the repo (and thus interrupted the connection between my local repo and this Git repo)

Debugging: As a beginner, I ran into CSS styling errors like placards not showing properly and misaligned text and did not know how to fix them.

Ignorance and Inexperience: Unsure of what actual technologies, time, and effort is needed to create an MVP that is sufficient for a proof of concept

Time Management: Keeping app development within 2 weeks scope - I spent 4 weeks on developing this app.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

Refine Skills: Review HTML/CSS elements/functions
